/**
 * Validates a user mobile number.
 *
 * Here is the documentation from AWS Cognito
 * on valid mobile numbers:
 *
 * ```
 * Phone numbers must follow these formatting rules:
 * A phone number must start with a plus (+) sign, followed
 * immediately by the country code. A phone number
 * can only contain the + sign and digits.
 * You must remove any other characters
 * from a phone number, such as parentheses, spaces,
 * or dashes (-) before submitting the value
 * to the service. For example, a United States-based
 * phone number must follow this format: +14325551212.
 * ```
 *
 * See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html
 *
 * Return true when `mobile` is null/undefined.
 * If a field needs to be defined, then failure
 * should be caused by `field.required()`
 * rather than this rule.
 *
