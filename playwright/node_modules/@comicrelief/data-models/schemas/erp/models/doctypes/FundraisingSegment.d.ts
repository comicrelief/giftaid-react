 * The FundraisingSegment doctype is essentially a sub category of
 *  FundraisingGroup.
 *
 * It is a replacement for OrganisationType, which wasn't quite generic
 *  enough, as some values weren't really organisation types. Having said that,
 *  the majority of FundraisingSegment values will be organisation types
 *  (e.g. secondary_school, youth_group etc.)
 *
 * ERP entries (E.g. organisations, fundraiser signups, payin records) should
 *  always be linked to FundraisingSegment records rather than FundraisingGroup
 *  ones. Their FundraisingGroup can be derived from this.
